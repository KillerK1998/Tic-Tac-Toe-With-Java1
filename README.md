# Overview

In this program I wanted to try my hand at using Java since I've heard that it is somewhat similar to C++ and C# which I am more experienced at using

I made a simple Tic Tac Toe game that constructs the board in the terminal of the engine that I used, and it allows two users to play the game until there is either a winner or it ends in a draw.

I decided to write this program because I figured that it would be a fun way to learn Java, and I thought that by making a simple game it would make the learning experience a lot more fun.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I wrote my Code in Visual Studio code with the Java Language that was provided in the software

Java from what I heard is the early cousin of C++ and C#, I figured that it would be a fun language to dip my toes into, and since I had prior knowledge in C++ and C# I thought that it would be worthwhile to learn.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Make the program look a bit nicer to look at
- maybe add a function that opens up to a nicer looking version of the Tic Tac Toe Game.
- and I really wanna try to make it more interactive for the user of the program.
